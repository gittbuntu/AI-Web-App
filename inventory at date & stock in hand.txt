 Unvalidated (Pending) Stock Moves

Stock at Any Location (Current Date) only considers validated (Done) moves up to the current moment.

Inventory at Date can include scheduled (but not yet validated) moves if the report is configured to account for future commitments.

Example Scenario:
Jan 15:

Confirmed Delivery (Outgoing Move, Not Yet Done): -20

Confirmed Purchase Order (Incoming Move, Not Yet Done): +40

Stock at Any Location (Jan 15):

Only counts Done moves → Shows 120 (100 + 50 - 30, as before).

Inventory at Date (Jan 15, with Future Moves Enabled):

Includes planned moves → Shows 140 (120 - 20 + 40).
